"Dhritarashtra said, What did the sons of Pandu and also my people do when they assembled together on the holy field of Kurukshetra, eager to fight, O Sanjaya?",
"Sanjaya said Having seen the army of Pandavas drawn up in battle array, King Duryodhana then approached his teacher, Drona, and spoke these words.",
"Behold, O Teacher, this mighty army of the sons of Pandu, arrayed by the son of Drupada, your wise disciple.",
"Here are heroes, mighty archers, equal in battle to Bhima and Arjuna, Yuyudhana, Virata and Drupada, the great chariot warrior.",
"Dhrishtaketu, Chekitana and the valiant king of Kasi, Purujit, Kuntibhoja and Saibya, the best among men.",
"The courageous Yudhamanyu, the brave Uttamauja, Saubhadra and the sons of Draupadi - all great chariot-warriors.",
"Know also, O the best among the twice born, the names of those who are most distinguished amongst ourselves, the leaders of my army. These I relate to you for your information.",
"Yourself and Bhishma and Karna and Kripa, the victorious in war, Aswatthama and Vikarna and Jayadratha, the son of Somadatta.",
"And many other heroes also, well-skilled in warfare and armed with many kinds of weapons are here; ready to lay down their lives for my sake",
"Our army defended by Bhishma is insufficient but the army of theirs defended by Bhima is sufficient.",
"Now all of you being stationed in your respective positions in the divisions of the army guard Bhishma alone by all means.",
"Then the powerful Bhishma, grandsire and oldest of the Kauravas, roared like a lion and blew his conch in order to cheer up Duryodhana.",
"Then (following Bhishma) conches, kettle drums, tabors, trumpets and cow-horns suddenly blared forth from the Kaurava side creating a tumultuous noise.",
"Then stationed in their magnificent chariot, yoked with white horses, Madhava (Krishna) and the son of Pandu (Arjuna) also blew their divine conches with a furious noise.",
"Hrishikesha (Krishna) blew the conch, Panchajanya, Dhananjaya (Arjuna) blew the Devadatta and Bhima, the doer of terrible deeds, blew the great conch, Paundra.",
"King Yudhishtira, the son of Kunti, blew the Anantavijaya, Nakula and Sahadeva blew the Sughosha and Manipushpaka conches respectively.",
"The king of Kasi, an excellent archer, Sikhandi, the mighty chariot-warrior, Dhrshtadyumna, Virata and Satyaki, the unconquered.",
"Drupada and the sons of Draupadi, O Lord of the earth, and the son of Subhadra, the mighty armed, blew their respective conches.",
"The tumultuous sound of the conches pierced the hearts of the members of the Dhritarashtra's side, making both the sky and earth resound.",
"Then, O Lord of the earth, seeing Dhritarashtra's men being positioned and discharge of weapons about to begin, Pandava (Arjuna), spoke.",
"Arjuna, whose ensign was Hanuman, raising his bow, spoke the following words to Krishna, O Achyuta (Krishna) place my chariot in between both the armies",
"Arjuna said, O Achyuta (Krishna) I have to survey those who stand here eager to fight. Let me know on the eve of this battle with whom I have to fight.",
"For, I desire to have a glance at those who are assembled here to fight, wishing to please the perverted son of Dhritarashtra.",
"Sanjaya said, O Bharata (Dhritarashtra), thus requested by Gudakesha (Arjuna), Hrishikesha placed the magnificent chariot between the two armies in front of Bhishma and Drona",
"Hrishikesha placed the magnificent chariot between the two armies in front of Bhishma and Drona and the other rulers of the earth and said 'O Partha (Arjuna), behold all these Kurus assembled here'",
"Then Arjuna saw stationed there in the armies, uncles, grandfathers, teachers, maternal uncles, brothers, sons, grandsons and friends too.",
"He saw fathers-in-law and friends also in both armies. Kaunteya (son of Kunti) i.e. Arjuna seeing all these relatives arrayed there, became overwhelmed by supreme compassion",
"Arjuna, seeing all these relatives arrayed there, became overwhelmed by supreme compassion, said this sorrowfully, O Krishna, seeing these relatives and friends gathered here eager to fight",
"My limbs fail me and my mouth gets parched up, my body trembles and my hairs stand on end.",
"The Gandiva (bow) slips from my hand and my skin burns all over; I am unable even to stand steady and my mind is reeling.",
"And I see evil omens, O Kesava (Krishna), I do not see any good in killing my own people in this battle.",
"For, I do not desire victory, O, Krishna, or pleasures or kingdoms. Of what avail is kingdom to us O, Govinda (Krishna), or pleasures or even life?",
"Those for whose sake we desire kingdoms, enjoyments and pleasures, stand here in battle staking their life and wealth.",
"Teachers, fathers, sons and also grandfathers, uncles and fathers-in-law, grandsons and brothers-in-law and other relatives",
"O, Madhusudana (Krishna), though these were to kill me, I do not wish to kill them even for the sake of dominion over the three worlds, leave alone killing them for the sake of the earth.",
"By killing these sons of Dhritarashtra, what pleasures can be ours O, Janardana (Krishna)? Only sin will accrue by killing these felons.",
"Therefore, we should not kill the sons of Dhritarashtra, our relatives; for, how can we be happy by killing our own people, O, Madhava (Krishna)?",
"O Janardana, though with their intelligence overpowered by greed they do not see any evil or sin in the destruction of families or hostility towards friends",
"Why should not we who clearly see evil in the destruction of a family, learn to turn away from this sin.",
"In the destruction of a family, its ancient religious traditions perish; on the destruction of spirituality, lawlessness overtakes the whole family.",
"And when lawlessness prevails, O Krishna, the women of the family become corrupt and when women become corrupted it results in intermingling of castes O, Varshneya Krishna).",
"Admixture of castes leads the family and the slayers of the family to hell because the spirits of their ancestors fall, deprived of the offerings of rice and water.",
"By these evil deeds of the destroyers of the family, which cause confusion of castes, the traditional duties of the caste and the family are destroyed.",
"O, Janardana, we have heard that dwelling in hell for an infinite period is inevitable for those people whose family duties have been destroyed.",
"Alas, what a pity that we have resolved to commit a great sin by being eager to kill our own kith and kin out of greed for the pleasures of a kingdom!",
"It would, indeed be better for me if the sons of Dhritarashtra, armed with weapons, were to kill me in the battle while I remain unarmed and unresisting",
"Sanjaya said, Having spoken thus in the midst of the battlefield, Arjuna, throwing away his bow and arrows, sank into the seat of the chariot, with his mind afflicted by sorrow"
],
[
"Sanjaya said, To him who was thus overwhelmed with pity and sorrow and whose eyes were dimmed with tears, Madhusudana (Krishna) spoke these words",
"Sri Bhagavan said, O Arjuna, at this moment of crisis, wherefrom have you got this weakness, un-Aryan like, disgraceful and which is not conducive to the attainment of heaven?",
"O Partha (Son of Pritha, Kunti), yield not to unmanliness. It does not befit you. Cast off, this petty faint-heartedness and arise, O Paranthapa (scorcherer of foes - Arjuna).",
"Arjuna said, But O Madhusudana, how can I strike Bhishma and Drona with arrows in this battle, for they are worthy of worship, O Arisudana (Destroyer of enemies - Krishna)?",
"It is better to live in this world by begging than to slay these honored teachers. By slaying them I would enjoy in this world pleasures which are stained with blood.",
"I can hardly tell which will be better - to fight or not to fight, that we should conquer them or they should conquer us. The very sons of Dhritarashtra after slaying whom we do not even wish to live stand facing us.",
"With my nature stricken with weakness of sentimental pity and my mind bewildered about my duty, I request you to tell me for certain what is good for me. I am your disciple. Please teach me. I am seeking refuge in you.",
"For, even after obtaining an undisputed sovereignty and an affluent kingdom on this, earth and lordship over the Gods, I do not see any means of driving away this grief which is drying up my senses.",
"Sanjaya said, Having thus spoken to Hrishikesa (Krishna), Arjuna the destroyer of foes (Parantapa), said to Govinda (Krishna) I will not fight and became silent.",
"O descendent of Bharata (Dhritarashtra), then Krishna, as if smiling, spoke these words to him (Arjuna) thus depressed in the midst of the two armies.",
"Sri Bhagavan said, You grieve for those who are not to be grieved for; and yet you speak words of wisdom! The learned do not grieve for the departed and those who have not departed",
"It is not that I did not exist before, nor you nor these kings. Nor is it that we shall cease to exist in future.",
"Just as in this body the embodied self passes into childhood, youth and old age, so also he passes into another body; calm man does not grieve at it.",
"The contacts of the senses with objects, O son of Kunti, which cause heat and cold, pleasure and pain have a beginning and an end; they are impermanent; endure them bravely, O descendent of Bharata (Arjuna)",
"That calm man who remains unchanged in pain and pleasure, whom these cannot disturb, alone is able, O greatest amongst men, to attain immortality.",
"The unreal has no existence. The Real never ceases to be (never ceases to exist). Men possessed of the knowledge of the Truth fully know both these.",
"Know that to be indestructible, by whom all this is pervaded. None can cause the destruction of that, the Imperishable.",
"Only the bodies, of which this eternal, imperishable, and incomprehensible Self is the indweller, are said to have an end. Therefore, O descendent of Bharata (Arjuna) fight.",
"He who looks on the Self to be the slayer and he who looks on the Self as the slain - neither of them apprehends correctly. The Self neither slays nor is slain",
"He is never born nor does He ever die; after having been, He again does not cease to be. Unborn, eternal, changeless and ancient. He is not killed when the body is killed.",
"Whosoever knows Him to be indestructible, eternal, unborn and immutable, how can that man slay, O Arjuna, or cause another to slay?",
"Just as a man casts off his worn-out clothes and puts on new ones, so also the embodied Self casts off Its worn out bodies and enters that are new",
"Weapons cannot cut It, nor can fire burn It; water cannot wet It, nor can wind dry It",
"This Self cannot be cut, burnt, wetted or dried up. It is eternal, all-pervading, stable, ancient and immovable",
"The Self is unmanifest, unthinkable and unchangeable. Therefore, knowing it to be as such, you should not grieve",
"But even if you think of it as being perpetually born and perpetually dying, even then, O Mighty Armed (Arjuna), you should not grieve.",
"Death is sure to happen to that which is born. Birth is sure to happen to that which dies. Birth and death are certainly unavoidable. Therefore you should not grieve over an inevitable occurrence.",
"Beings are unmanifest in their beginning, manifest in their middle state and unmanifest again in their end O, Arjuna. What is there to grieve about?",
"Some look on the Self as a wonder; some speak of It as a wonder; some hear of It as a wonder; still others, though hearing, do not understand It at all.",
"This Self, the indweller in the body of everyone, is always indestructible. O, Arjuna, therefore you should not grieve for any creature.",
"Further having regard to your duty (your own Dharma) you should not waver, for there is nothing higher for a Kshatriya than a righteous war.",
"Happy are the Kshatriyas who are called upon to fight in such a battle that comes of itself unsought as an open door to heaven, O Arjuna",
"But if you will not fight in this lawful battle, then, having abandoned your own Dharma and honor, you shall incur sin",
"People too will recount for ever your infamy; to a man who has been honored dishonor is worse than death.",
"The great chariot-warriors (such as Bhishma, Drona, Kripa etc.) will think that you have withdrawn from the battle through fear and you will be ridiculed by them who held you in much esteem.",
"Your enemies also, finding fault with your abilities, will speak many a word that should, not be uttered. What could be more painful than this?",

"Treating alike pleasure and pain, gain and loss, victory and defeat, engage in battle for the sake of the battle, thus you shall not incur sin.",
"What has been declared to you so far is the wisdom of sankhya. Now listen to the wisdom of yoga, armed with which, O son of Pritha, you will break through the bonds of Karma.",
"In this no effort is ever lost and no harm is ever done. Even very little of this discipline (Dharma) saves a man from the Great Fear.",
"O Joy of the Kurus (Arjuna), in this blessed path, there is a concentrated one-pointed determination. Scattered and endless are the thoughts of the irresolute or the undecided.",
"Arjuna, those who are obsessed by desires, who look upon heaven as the supreme goal and argue that there is nothing beyond heaven and pleasures and who are devoted to the letter of the Vedas are unwise.",
"They make this type of flowery speeches recommending many acts of various kinds, for the attainment of pleasure and prosperity and with rebirth as their motive.",
"Those whose minds are carried away by such flowery words (who are attracted by and attached to pleasures and prosperity) are not well-established in the Self (in concentration).",
"The Vedas deal with three attributes (of nature); you be above these three attributes, O Arjuna. Free yourself from the pairs of opposites and ever remain in the quality of sattwa (goodness), freed from all thoughts of acquisition (of what you lack) and preservation (of what you have) and be established in the Self.",
"To the Brahmana who has known the Self, all the Vedas are of as much use as is a reservoir of water in a place where there is a flood.",
"Your right is to work only, but never to claim its fruits. Do not become an instrument for making your actions yield fruit, nor let your attachment be to inaction.",
"Perform your actions, O Dhananjaya (Arjuna), being established in or integrated with Yoga, abandoning attachment and remaining even-minded both in success and failure. This Evenness of mind is called Yoga.",
"O Arjuna, far inferior, indeed, is mere action, to action performed with evenness of mind. Seek refuge in this evenness. Wretched are they who work for results",
"Endowed with evenness of mind, one casts off in this very life both good and evil deeds. Therefore, devote yourself to Yoga (of equanimity); skill in action lies in the practice of this Yoga.",
"The wise, possessed of equanimity, having abandoned the fruits of their actions and being freed from the fetters of birth, attain the state that is beyond all evil (reaches the blissful supreme state)",
"When your mind crosses beyond the mire of delusion, then you shall achieve indifference regarding things already heard and things yet to be heard (about enjoyments of this world or the next).",
"When your mind, now perplexed by what you have heard, stands firm and steady in the Self, then you will have attained Yoga or Self-Realization",
"Arjuna said, O Keshava, what is the description of him who has steady wisdom and is merged in the super conscious state (Samadhi)? How does one of steady wisdom speak? How does he sit? How does he walk?",
"Sri Bhagavan said, O Partha, when a man completely casts off all the desires of the mind, his Self finding satisfaction in itself alone, then he is called a man of steady wisdom.",
"He whose mind is not shaken by adversity, who does not hanker after pleasures and who is free from attachment, fear and anger, is called a sage of steady wisdom",
"He who is not attached to anything, who neither rejoices nor is, vexed when he obtains good or evil - his wisdom is firmly fixed.",
"When like the tortoise which withdraws its limbs on all sides, he withdraws his senses from the sense objects, then his wisdom becomes steady",
"The objects of the senses fall away from the abstinent man but not the taste for them. But even the taste falls away when the Supreme is seen.",
"The turbulent senses, O son of Kunti, do violently carry away the mind even of a wise man though he may be striving to control them.",
"Having restrained all the senses he should sit steadfast, intent on Me; his wisdom is steady whose senses are under control.",
"When a man thinks of objects, attachment for them arises; from attachment desire is born; from desire arises anger.",
"From anger comes delusion, from delusion the loss of memory, from the loss of memory the destruction of intelligence; from the destruction of intelligence he perishes.",
"But the self-controlled man, moving among objects with his senses under restraint and free from both attraction and repulsion, attains peace",
"In that serenity there is an end of all sorrow; for the intelligence of the man of serene mind soon becomes steady.",
"The man whose mind is not under his control has no Self-Knowledge and to the unsteady no meditation is possible and to the unmeditative there can be no peace and to the man who has no peace how can there be any happiness?",
"When the mind runs after the wandering senses, it carries away his discrimination as the wind carries away a boat on the waters.",
"Therefore, O Mighty Armed Arjuna, his wisdom is steady whose senses are completely restrained from their objects.",
"In that which is night to all beings, the self-controlled man is awake and where all beings are awake, that is the night for the man who sees (has vision).",
"He attains peace into whom all desires enter as the waters enter the ocean, which is full to the brim and grounded in stillness, but not the man who is the desirer of desires.",
"That man attains peace who, abandoning all desires, moves about without longing, devoid of the sense of 'I'-ness and 'my'-ness.",
"This is the Brahmi-state, O Son of Pritha. Attaining this, none is deluded. Being established therein, even at the hour of death, one attains final liberation in Brahman."

"The world is in bondage to work unless they are performed for the sake of Yajna (sacrifice). Therefore, O Son of Kunti, give up attachment and do your work as a sacrifice.",

"Cherish the Devas with this and may those Devas cherish you, thus cherishing one another you shall gain the highest good.",
"Devas, cherished by the sacrifice, will give you the desired objects. Indeed, he who enjoys objects given by the Devas without offering in return to them is verily a thief.",

"From food all creatures are born; from rain food is produced; from sacrifice comes rain; sacrifice is born of action",

"As the ignorant men act from attachment to work, O Bharata (Arjuna), so should the wise act without attachment, wishing the welfare of the world.",

"All actions are being performed by the Gunas of Prakriti. But he, whose mind is deluded by egoism, thinks 'I am the doer'.",
"But he who has true insight into the respective spheres of Gunas and their actions, holding that it is the Gunas (in the form of senses, mind etc.) that move among the Gunas (objects of perception) does not get attached to them, O Mighty Arjuna.",

"The love and hatred that the senses feel for their objects are inevitable. But let none come under their sway; for, they are his enemies.",
"Better is one's own duty, though imperfectly performed, than the duty of another well performed. Better is death in the doing of one's own duty; the duty of another is fraught with peril.",
"Arjuna said, But under what compulsion does a man commit sin, in spite of himself, O Varshneya, and driven, as it were, by force?",
"Sri Bhagavan said, It is desire, it is anger born out of the quality of Rajas, all sinful and all devouring ; know this as the foe here (in this world).",
