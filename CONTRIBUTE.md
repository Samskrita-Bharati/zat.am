## 🚀 How to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repository**: Click the "Fork" button at the top of the repository and clone your fork to your local machine.
2. **Create a Feature Branch**:  
   - Name your branch descriptively, such as `feature-new-login-ui` or `fix-bug-issue-42`.  
   - Use the format: `feature/[short-description]` or `fix/[short-description]`.  
3. **Write and Test Your Code**:  
   - Ensure your code works as expected before submitting.  
   - Add appropriate **unit tests** and run existing tests to verify nothing breaks.  
4. **Document Your Changes**:  
   - Add or update inline comments where necessary.  
   - If your contribution modifies functionality, update the relevant documentation (`README.md`, `docs/`, or code comments).  
5. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**:  
   - Push your branch to your fork.  
   - Open a pull request (PR) against the `main` (or `develop`) branch.  
   - Include a clear and concise description of your changes.  
   - Reference any related issues (`Fixes #42` if applicable).  
6. **Wait for Review**:  
   - A project maintainer will review your PR and may request changes.  
   - Once approved, the PR will be merged.  

## ✅ Code Quality Checklist

Before submitting a PR, please ensure that:  
- [ ] Your code follows the project’s coding style and best practices.  
- [ ] You have tested your changes and they work as expected.  
- [ ] You have added or updated relevant documentation.  
- [ ] Your code does not introduce new security vulnerabilities.  

## ❌ Things to Avoid

- Do not commit directly to the `main` or `develop` branch. Always use feature branches.  
- Do not submit incomplete code—make sure it’s functional and documented.  
- Avoid large, unrelated changes in a single PR.
